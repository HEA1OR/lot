One of these is that the controls will bring about a shortage of rental units. This disadvantage for renters occurs over the long run, but the advantage -- smaller rent increases -- occurs immediately. In many municipalities, specifically in all those where tenants of rent-control units have a secure hold on political power and can get rent-control ordinances enacted or repealed, it is invariably the desire for short-term gain that guides those tenants in the exercise of that power.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following can be properly inferred from them?\nChoices:\n(A) In many municipalities there is now, or eventually will be, a shortage of rental units.\n(B) In many municipalities rent-control ordinances are repealed as soon as shortages of rental units arise.\n(C) It is impossible for landlords to raise rents when rent controls are in effect.\n(D) The only negative effect of rent control for renters is that it brings about a shortage of rental units.\n\"\"\"\n",

This is because the rational pursuit of happiness must include consideration of long-term consequences, whereas our desires are usually focused on the short term.

For lunch, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For dinner, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For a snack, each eats exactly one of the following: fish or omelet. Wendy eats an omelet for lunch.\nQuestion: Vladimir must eat which one of the following foods?\nChoices:\n(A) fish\n(B) hot cakes\n(C) macaroni\n(D) omelet\n\"\"\"\n# declare variables\npeople = EnumSort([Vladimir, Wendy])\nmeals = EnumSort([breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack])\nfoods = EnumSort([fish, hot_cakes, macaroni, omelet, poached_eggs])\neats = Function(people, meals, foods)\n\n# Question: Vladimir must eat which one of the following foods?\n# we check whether the options must be true\nprint(check_valid())\n\n\n\n### write python code to answer the question\n\"\"\"\nPollen and other allergens can cause cells in the nose to release histamine, a chemical that inflames nasal tissue and causes runny nose, congestion, and sneezing. Antihistamines minimize these allergy symptoms by blocking the action of histamine. In addition, antihistamines have other effects, including drowsiness. However, histamine plays no role in the processes by which colds produce their symptoms.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?\nChoices:\n(A) The sleeplessness that sometimes accompanies allergies can be effectively treated with antihistamines.\n(B) Pollen and other allergens do not cause colds.\n(C) Antihistamines, when taken alone, are ineffective against congestion caused by colds.\n(D) Any effect antihistamines may have in reducing cold symptoms does not result from blocking the action of histamine.\n\"\"\"\n",

Yet the fact that the tools used by these two groups of hominids living in different environments were of exactly the same type indicates uncanny behavioral similarities, for only if they faced the same daily challenges and met them in the same way would they have used such similar tools. This suggests that they were members of the same species, and that the morphological differences are due merely to their having lived in different environments.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n(A) The daily challenges with which an environment confronts its inhabitants are unique to that environment.\n(B) Use of similar tools is required if members of two distinct groups of tool-making hominids are to be considered members of the same species.\n(C) Morphological differences between the members of two populations do not guarantee that the two populations do not belong to the same species.\n(D) Through much of their coexistence, Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals were geographically isolated from one another.\n\"\"\"\n",

I is opened after K.\nQuestion: Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n(A) H\n(B) I\n(C) K\n(D) N\n\"\"\"\n# declare variables\nvalves = EnumSort([G, H, I, K, L, N, O, P])\nopened = Function(valves, int)\nDistinct([v:valves], opened(v))\nForAll([v:valves], And(1 <= opened(v), opened(v) <= 8))\n\n# Question: Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:\n# we check whether the options can possibly be true, and find the exception\nprint(exception(check_sat()))\n\n\n\n### write python code to answer the question\n\"\"\"\nOn Tuesday Vladimir and Wendy each eat exactly four separate meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack. The following is all that is known about what they eat during that day: At no meal does Vladimir eat the same kind of food as Wendy. Neither of them eats the same kind of food more than once during the day. For breakfast, each eats exactly one of the following: hot cakes, poached eggs, or omelet. For lunch, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For dinner, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For a snack, each eats exactly one of the following: fish or omelet. Wendy eats an omelet for lunch.\nQuestion: Vladimir must eat which one of the following foods?\nChoices:\n(A) fish\n(B) hot cakes\n(C) macaroni\n(D) omelet\n\"\"\"\n# declare variables\npeople = EnumSort([Vladimir, Wendy])\nmeals = EnumSort([breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack])\nfoods = EnumSort([fish, hot_cakes, macaroni, omelet, poached_eggs])\neats = Function(people, meals, foods)\n\n# Question: Vladimir must eat which one of the following foods?\n# we check whether the options must be true\nprint(check_valid())\n\n\n\n### write python code to answer the question\n\"\"\"\nLegal theorist: Only two types of theories of criminal sentencing can be acceptable -- retributivist theories, which hold that the purpose of sentences is simply to punish, and rehabilitationist theories, which hold that a sentence is a means to reform the offender. A retributivist theory is not acceptable unless it conforms to the principle that the harshness of a punishment should be proportional to the seriousness of the offense. Retributivist theories that hold that criminals should receive longer sentences for repeat offenses than for an initial offense violate this principle, since repeat offenses may be no more serious than the initial offense.\nQuestion: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the legal theorist's statements?\nChoices:\n(A) Any rehabilitationist theory that holds that criminals should receive longer sentences for repeat offenses than for an initial offense is an acceptable theory.\n(B) Reforming a repeat offender sometimes requires giving that offender longer sentences for the repeat offenses than for the initial offense.\n(C) A theory of criminal sentencing that holds that criminals should receive longer sentences for repeat offenses than for an initial offense is acceptable only if it is a rehabilitationist theory.\n(D) All theories of criminal sentencing that conform to the principle that the harshness of a punishment should be proportional to the seriousness of the offense are acceptable.\n\"\"\"\n",

I is opened after K.\nQuestion: Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n(A) H\n(B) I\n(C) K\n(D) N\n\"\"\"\n# declare variables\nvalves = EnumSort([G, H, I, K, L, N, O, P])\nopened = Function(valves, int)\nDistinct([v:valves], opened(v))\nForAll([v:valves], And(1 <= opened(v), opened(v) <= 8))\n\n# Question: Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:\n# we check whether the options can possibly be true, and find the exception\nprint(exception(check_sat()))\n\n\n\n### write python code to answer the question\n\"\"\"\nOn Tuesday Vladimir and Wendy each eat exactly four separate meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack. The following is all that is known about what they eat during that day: At no meal does Vladimir eat the same kind of food as Wendy. Neither of them eats the same kind of food more than once during the day. For breakfast, each eats exactly one of the following: hot cakes, poached eggs, or omelet. For lunch, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For dinner, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For a snack, each eats exactly one of the following: fish or omelet. Wendy eats an omelet for lunch.\nQuestion: Vladimir must eat which one of the following foods?\nChoices:\n(A) fish\n(B) hot cakes\n(C) macaroni\n(D) omelet\n\"\"\"\n# declare variables\npeople = EnumSort([Vladimir, Wendy])\nmeals = EnumSort([breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack])\nfoods = EnumSort([fish, hot_cakes, macaroni, omelet, poached_eggs])\neats = Function(people, meals, foods)\n\n# Question: Vladimir must eat which one of the following foods?\n# we check whether the options must be true\nprint(check_valid())\n\n\n\n### write python code to answer the question\n\"\"\"\nOne of the great difficulties in establishing animal rights based merely on the fact that animals are living things concerns scope. If one construes the term \"living things\" broadly, one is bound to bestow rights on organisms that are not animals (e. g. , plants). But if this term is construed narrowly, one is apt to refuse rights to organisms that, at least biologically, are considered members of the animal kingdom.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following can be most reasonably inferred from them?\nChoices:\n(A) Successful attempts to establish rights for all animals are likely either to establish rights for some plants or not to depend solely on the observation that animals are living things.\n(B) The problem of delineating the boundary of the set of living things interferes with every attempt to establish animal rights.\n(C) Not all animals should be given rights.\n(D) One cannot bestow rights on animals without also bestowing rights on at least some plants.\n\"\"\"\n",

To counteract this problem, manufacturers add stabilizers to ice cream. Unfortunately, stabilizers, though inexpensive, adversely affect flavor. Stabilizers are less needed if storage temperatures are very low. However, since energy costs are constantly going up, those costs constitute a strong incentive in favor of relatively high storage temperatures.\nQuestion: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the passage?\nChoices:\n(A) Stabilizers function well only at very low freezer temperatures.\n(B) Cost considerations favor sacrificing consistency over sacrificing flavor.\n(C) Even slight deviations from the proper consistency for ice cream sharply impair its flavor.\n(D) Very low, stable freezer temperatures allow for the best possible consistency and flavor of ice cream.\n\"\"\"\n",

However, in general, retail stores that distribute and accept store coupons as a way of discounting the prices on certain products charge more for their products, on average, than other retail stores charge for the same products -- even after lower prices available on coupon-discounted products are factored in. This is because producing and distributing coupons usually costs a great deal. To compensate for this expense without reducing profits, retail stores must pass it on to consumers.\nQuestion: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the information above?\nChoices:\n(A) At least some retail stores that do not use coupons do not have expenses that they pass on to consumers.\n(B) The undiscounted price charged for a good for which a retail store offers a coupon will be higher than the price charged for that same good by a retail store that does not offer a coupon for it.\n(C) Many consumers who redeem coupons save little if any money, overall, by doing so.\n(D) Retail stores that distribute coupons generally compensate for the expense of producing and distributing coupons by charging higher prices for certain products.\n\"\"\"\n",

Neither of them eats the same kind of food more than once during the day. For breakfast, each eats exactly one of the following: hot cakes, poached eggs, or omelet. For lunch, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For dinner, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For a snack, each eats exactly one of the following: fish or omelet.

PharmCo has responded that obtaining such information would require massive clinical trials. These trials cannot be performed until the drug is in widespread circulation, something that will happen only if the government health service pays for Antinfia.\nQuestion: If the statements of both the government health service and PharmCo are true, which one of the following is most likely to also be true?\nChoices:\n(A) The government health service never pays for any medicine unless that medicine has been shown to be cost-effective.\n(B) The government health service should pay for patients to take Antinfia.\n(C) Antinfia will never be in widespread circulation.\n(D) If the government health service does not pay for Antinfia, then many patients will pay for Antinfia themselves.\n\"\"\"\n",
