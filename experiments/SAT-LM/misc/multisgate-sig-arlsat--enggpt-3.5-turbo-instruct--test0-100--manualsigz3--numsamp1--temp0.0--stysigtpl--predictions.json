I is opened after K.\nQuestion: Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n(A) H\n(B) I\n(C) K\n(D) N\n\"\"\"\n# declare variables\nvalves = EnumSort([G, H, I, K, L, N, O, P])\nopened = Function(valves, int)\nDistinct([v:valves], opened(v))\nForAll([v:valves], And(1 <= opened(v), opened(v) <= 8))\n\n# Question: Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:\n# we check whether the options can possibly be true, and find the exception\nprint(exception(check_sat()))\n\n\n\n### write python code to answer the question\n\"\"\"\nOn Tuesday Vladimir and Wendy each eat exactly four separate meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack.

I is opened after K.\nQuestion: Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n(A) H\n(B) I\n(C) K\n(D) N\n\"\"\"\n# declare variables\nvalves = EnumSort([G, H, I, K, L, N, O, P])\nopened = Function(valves, int)\nDistinct([v:valves], opened(v))\nForAll([v:valves], And(1 <= opened(v), opened(v) <= 8))\n\n# Question: Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:\n# we check whether the options can possibly be true, and find the exception\nprint(exception(check_sat()))\n\n\n\n### write python code to answer the question\n\"\"\"\nOn Tuesday Vladimir and Wendy each eat exactly four separate meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack.

For lunch, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For dinner, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For a snack, each eats exactly one of the following: fish or omelet.

Neither of them eats the same kind of food more than once during the day. For breakfast, each eats exactly one of the following: hot cakes, poached eggs, or omelet. For lunch, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For dinner, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For a snack, each eats exactly one of the following: fish or omelet. Wendy eats an omelet for lunch.\nQuestion: Vladimir must eat which one of the following foods?\nChoices:\n(A) fish\n(B) hot cakes\n(C) macaroni\n(D) omelet\n\"\"\"\n# declare variables\npeople = EnumSort([Vladimir, Wendy])\nmeals = EnumSort([breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack])\nfoods = EnumSort([fish, hot_cakes, macaroni, omelet, poached_eggs])\neats = Function(people, meals, foods)\n\n# Question: Vladimir must eat which one of the following foods?\n# we check whether the options must be true\nprint(check_valid())\n\n\n\n### write python code to answer the question\n\"\"\"\n3.《孙子兵法》曰：“兵贵胜，不贵久。”意思是说用兵的战术贵能取胜，贵在速战速决。然而，毛泽东的《论持久战》主张的却是持久战，中国军队靠持久战取得了抗日战争的胜利。可见，《论持久战》与《孙子兵法》在“兵不贵久”的观点上是不一致的。\nQuestion: 如果以下哪项陈述为真，能最有力地削弱上述论证？\nChoices:\n(A) 在二战期间，德国军队靠闪电战取得了一连串的胜利，打进苏联后被拖人持久战，结果希特勒重蹈拿破仑的覆辙。\n(B) 日本侵略者客场作战贵在速决，毛泽东的持久战是针对敌方速决战的反制之计，他讲的是战略持久，不是战术持久。\n(C) 目前在世界范围内进行的反恐战争，从局部或短期上看是速决战，从整体或长远上看是持久战。\n(D) 毛泽东的军事著作与《孙子兵法》在“知彼知己,百战不殆”和“攻其不备，出其不意”的观点上，具有高度的一致性。\n\"\"\"\n",

I is opened after K.\nQuestion: Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n(A) H\n(B) I\n(C) K\n(D) N\n\"\"\"\n# declare variables\nvalves = EnumSort([G, H, I, K, L, N, O, P])\nopened = Function(valves, int)\nDistinct([v:valves], opened(v))\nForAll([v:valves], And(1 <= opened(v), opened(v) <= 8))\n\n# Question: Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:\n# we check whether the options can possibly be true, and find the exception\nprint(exception(check_sat()))\n\n\n\n### write python code to answer the question\n\"\"\"\nOn Tuesday Vladimir and Wendy each eat exactly four separate meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack. The following is all that is known about what they eat during that day: At no meal does Vladimir eat the same kind of food as Wendy. Neither of them eats the same kind of food more than once during the day. For breakfast, each eats exactly one of the following: hot cakes, poached eggs, or omelet. For lunch, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For dinner, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet.

Wendy eats an omelet for lunch.\nQuestion: Vladimir must eat which one of the following foods?\nChoices:\n(A) fish\n(B) hot cakes\n(C) macaroni\n(D) omelet\n\"\"\"\n# declare variables\npeople = EnumSort([Vladimir, Wendy])\nmeals = EnumSort([breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack])\nfoods = EnumSort([fish, hot_cakes, macaroni, omelet, poached_eggs])\neats = Function(people, meals, foods)\n\n# Question: Vladimir must eat which one of the following foods?\n# we check whether the options must be true\nprint(check_valid())\n\n\n\n### write python code to answer the question\n\"\"\"\n25.销售专家认为，在一个不再扩张的市场中，一个公司最佳的销售策略就是追求最大的市场份额，而达到目标的最佳方式就是做一些能突出竞争对手缺点的比较广告。在国内萧条的奶粉市场中，A牌奶粉与B牌奶粉进行了两年的比较广告战，相互指责对方产品对婴儿的健康造成有害影响。然而，这些广告战并没有使各自的市场份额增大，反而使很多人不再购买任何品牌的国产奶粉。\nQuestion: 以上陈述最强地支持下面哪一个结论?\nChoices:\n(A) 不应该在一个正在扩张或可能扩张的市场中使用比较广告。\n(B) 比较广告冒有使它们的目标市场不是扩张而是收缩的风险。\n(C) 比较广告不会产生任何长期效益，除非消费者能很容易地判断那些广告的正确性。\n(D) 如果一个公司的产品比其竞争对手产品的质量明显高出一筹的话，比较广告在任何情况下都能增加该公司产品的市场份额。\n\"\"\"\n",
